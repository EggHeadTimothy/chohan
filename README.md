# chohan
This program is based off of the description of a program called Chohan from Al Sweigart's "The Big Book of Small Python 
Projects". I wrote this program in both Python and C (mainly to practice programming in C). The file chohan_2p.py is an
older version of the Python code, however it is left in because of the implementation of a computer-controlled Player 2.
